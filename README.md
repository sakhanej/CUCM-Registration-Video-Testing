## Overview
This repository can provide you python scripts which can be used:

#### Unified Collaboration Products
  1. CUCM Registration Reports
  2. UC Services Status
  3. CUCM Firmware Analysis
  4. CUCM Login Checks (verifies if LDAP users can login)
#### Video Endpoints
  5. Migrating Endpoints from VCS to CUCM
  6. Operational Readiness Testing(ORT) of Video Endpoints
#### Gateways
  7. BoM Creation (Under Development)

## Pre-Requisites
Following are the pre-requisites for the script to function properly:

 - Refer **requirements.txt** for python version and libraries required to run the scripts.
 - Convert python scripts to executable files (here is a small [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOIJIk_maO4) on how it can be done).
 - **Unified Collaboration Products**:
    - Make sure following services are functioning properly:
        - SOAP -Real-Time Service APIs
	- SOAP -Performance Monitoring APIs
        - Cisco AXL Web Service
    - Configure 1 application user with following roles:
        - Standard AXL API Access
        - Standard CCM Admin Users
        - Standard CUReporting
        - Standard RealtimeAndTraceCollection
        - Standard SERVICEABILITY Administration
    - Make sure you can access CUCM WSDL (as this script uses WSDL Implementation). Links to check:
        - **Verify AXL**: https://ipaddress:8443/axl/
        - **Verify ServiceWSDL**: https://ipaddress:8443/controlcenterservice/services/ControlCenterServicesPort
        - **Verify RISWSDL**: https://ipaddress:8443/realtimeservice2/services/RISService70?wsdl
    - For Login Checks, web scrapping mechanism is used.
  
  - **Video Endpoints**:
    - Endpoints should have web-access enabled since the script uses XML-Based APIâ€™s for Endpoints, preferably HTTP + HTTPS.
    - Endpoint should be running on TC7.3.6 or above / CE8.X / CE9.X, lower firmware versions have not been tested.
    - The system executing the script should be able to access the webpage of the endpoints ensuring the IP reachability.
    - There should be a dedicated set of test endpoints and bridges reserved for testing that can be used by this script.
